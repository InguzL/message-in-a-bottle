Message in a Bottle is going to be a web application that allows users to submit messages that will then be "found" by other users who will be sent the message on a Monday. 

The messages are like those old letters people used to put inside a bottle and throw into the sea. If your letter passes our approval process, it gets added to the permanent 
database and your message will be sent to one person each week in an email. The idea is to be an uplifting experience for the user and a great way to start the week.

Letters can be about a personal story that's uplifting, a letter to someone you love or even something beautiful that you want to share anonymously. As long as we can tell time 
and effort has gone into the letter, it's sure to be approved and you can sleep well knowing that you're brightening up someone's day at the start of every week!
